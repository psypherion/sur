    "lyrics": "I remember it all very well looking back\nIt was the summer I turned eighteen\nWe lived in a one-room, rundown shack\nOn the outskirts of New Orleans\nWe didn't have money for food or rent\nTo say the least, we were hard pressed\nThen mama spent every last penny we had\nTo buy me a dancing dress\nWell, Mama washed and combed and curled my hair\nThen she painted my eyes and lips (Lips)\nThen I stepped into a satin dancing dress\nThat had a split on the side clean up to my hip\nIt was red velvet trim and it had fit me good\nWell, standing back from the looking glass\nThere stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood\n\nShe said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\"\nShe said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\"\n\nMama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck\nThen she kissed my cheek\nAnd then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes\nAs she started to speak\nShe looked at our pitiful shack\nAnd then she looked at me and took a ragged breath\nShe said, \"Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick\nAnd the baby's gonna starve to death\"\nShe handed me a heart-shaped locket that said\n\"To thine own self be true\"\nAnd I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across\nThe toe of my high-heeled shoe\nIt sounded like somebody else that was talking\nAsking Mama, \"What do I do?\"\nShe said, \"Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy\nThey'll be nice to you\"\n\nShe said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\nHere's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\nLord, forgive me for what I do\nBut if you want out, well, it's up to you\nNow don't let me down now\nYour Mama's gonna move you uptown\"\n\nWell, that was the last time I saw my Ma\nThe night I left that rickety shack\nThe welfare people came and took the baby\nMama died and I ain't been back\nBut the wheels of fate had started to turn\nAnd for me there was no way out\nIt wasn't very long until I knew exactly\nWhat my Mama'd been talking about\nI knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow\nThat I was gonna be a lady someday\nThough I didn't know when or how\nBut I couldn't see spending the rest of my life\nWith my head hung down in shame\nYou know I might've been born just plain white trash\nBut Fancy was my name\n\nShe said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\"\nShe said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\"\n\nIt wasn't long after a benevolent man\nTook me in off the streets\nAnd one week later I was pouring his tea\nIn a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was)\nI charmed a king, congressman\nAnd an occasional aristocrat\nThen I got me a Georgia mansion\nAnd an elegant New York townhouse flat\nAnd I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)\n\nNow in this world\nThere's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad\nThey criticize Mama for turning me out\nNo matter how little we had\nBut though I ain't had to worry about nothing\nFor nigh on fifteen years\nWell, I can still hear the desperation\nIn my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears\n\n\"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\nOh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\nLord, forgive me for what I do\nBut if you want out, well, it's up to you\nNow don't let me down, hon'\nYour Mama's gonna move you uptown\"\nOh, and I guess she did"

Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker\nThis is the autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\n\nDamn, that shit was dope!"

Everybody's jokin' now\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow\nSnap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity\nOpe, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad\nBut he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it\nHe knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter\nHe's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant\nHe knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody\nBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n\nHis soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping\nThis world is mine for the taking, make me king\nAs we move toward a new world order\nA normal life is boring, but superstardom's\nClose to post-mortem, it only grows harder\nHomie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over\nThese hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows\nHe's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads\nGod only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera\nIs told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner\nBut the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher\nBest believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the\nFact that I can't get by with my nine-to-\nFive and I can't provide the right type of life for my family\n'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder\nTryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter\nCaught up between bein' a father and a prima donna\nBaby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me\nTo the point I'm like a snail, I've got\nTo formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got\nTo go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot\nSo here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man"

Oh\n\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one, and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

(Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya?\n\nPour out some liquor and I reminisce\n'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama\nAnd when it seems that I'm hopeless\nYou say the words that can get me back in focus\nWhen I was sick as a little kid\nTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did\nAnd all my childhood memories\nAre full of all the sweet things you did for me\nAnd even though I act crazy\nI gotta thank the Lord that you made me\nThere are no words that can express how I feel\nYou never kept a secret, always stayed real\nAnd I appreciate how you raised me\nAnd all the extra love that you gave me\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll on\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\n[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, \n2Pac\n]\nLady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)\nLady, lady"

    "lyrics": "I've got dirt on my Reeboks from staying out all night\nI spent my last ten pounds on this pack of Marlboro Lights\nI phoned up Stevie, I said \"G, you alright?\"\nHe said \"It's six in the morning, brother! Get some shut-eye!\"\nI feel a sense of well-being this time in the morning\nWear my heart out on my hoodie while the city is snoring\nDrunks falling off the sidewalks, get issued a warning\nDistant sirens, they crescendo like a symphony calling\nThis it the Britain I know, this is the Britain I love\nThere's poetry inside this city if you listen enough\nWorking class causalities out on the streets sleep rough\nWhile a mother with her baby takes her pram to the pub\nAnd while she's knocking them down, the cost of living goes up\nI can't relate to politicians with their head in the mud\nI resonate with messy Fridays, with the boys smoking bud\nWe do our bit to numb the struggle, as below, so above\nAs as above, so below, here in the city we glow\nI blow a smoke ring up to heaven and it makes a halo\nAnd then the clock strikes seven, guess it's time to head home\nMy companion is the city, so I'm never alone\nI'm stepping in and out of gaps of the pavement cracks\nAnd if I go to sleep now, that's an anti-climax\nPeople rise for work and the sun mirrors that\nA perfect juxtaposition for those out on the lash\nBare with me, it's beautiful, I think its irrefutable\nThere's beauty in a contradicting Britain... Indisputable\nJunkie in a cubicle, that old spoon is usable\nHis mother's in a black suit, crying at a funeral\nNine to five crucible, this route is not commutable\nA kid falls off the tracks and then he serves a stretch in Juvenal\nLibbies at the Doleys but her dispositions humourful\nWhile Davey's at the bookies and his mates call him delusional\nBritain, drink it down and moan about the weather\nWhen the sun starts shining feel the factor 10 tremor\nBoys will be boys, will be in it together\nUntil the fists start flying like they're Connor McGregor\nAnd then he's out... I think he took it too far\nI think the boy saw red, I think he hit him too hard\nNow he's face down on the pavement with a face full of tar\nMad how small altercations can define who we are\nThat's my cue! I guess it's time to head home\nIt's bittersweet how my high found its way to be low\nAnd I've said it once before, as above, so below\nLiving on the streets of Britain you just go with the flow\n\nBut I'm done, I'm out for the night\nAs the sun paints the pavements, I'll turn out the light\nWhite noise on the radio to quiet my mind\nAlways was an overthinker, just the way I'm designed\nBritain, drink it down and moan about the weather\nWhen it's all said and done we'll be in it altogether\nBoys will be boys, will be like it forever\nIt's a bittersweet symphony, we're birds of a feather"

    "lyrics": "A long, long time ago\nI can still remember how that music\nUsed to make me smile\nAnd I knew if I had my chance\nThat I could make those people dance\nAnd maybe they'd be happy for a while\nBut February made me shiver\nWith every paper I'd deliver\nBad news on the doorstep\nI couldn't take one more step\nI can't remember if I cried\nWhen I read about his widowed bride\nBut something touched me deep inside\nThe day the music died\n\nSo, bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nAnd them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\"\n\nDid you write the book of love?\nAnd do you have faith in God above\nIf the Bible tells you so?\nNow, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?\nCan music save your mortal soul?\nAnd can you teach me how to dance real slow?\nWell, I know that you're in love with him\n'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym\nYou both kicked off your shoes\nMan, I dig those rhythm and blues\nI was a lonely teenage broncin' buck\nWith a pink carnation and a pickup truck\nBut I knew I was out of luck\nThe day the music died\n\nI started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\"\n\nNow, for ten years we've been on our own\nAnd moss grows fat on a rollin' stone\nBut that's not how it used to be\nWhen the jester sang for the king and queen\nIn a coat he borrowed from James Dean\nAnd a voice that came from you and me\nOh, and while the king was looking down\nThe jester stole his thorny crown\nThe courtroom was adjourned\nNo verdict was returned\nAnd while Lenin read a book on Marx\nThe quartet practiced in the park\nAnd we sang dirges in the dark\nThe day the music died\n\nWe were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\"\n\nHelter skelter in a summer swelter\nThe birds flew off with a fallout shelter\nEight miles high and fallin' fast\nIt landed foul on the grass\nThe players tried for a forward pass\nWith the jester on the sidelines in a cast\nNow, the halftime air was sweet perfume\nWhile sergeants played a marching tune\nWe all got up to dance\nOh, but we never got the chance\n'Cause the players tried to take the field\nThe marching band refused to yield\nDo you recall what was revealed\nThe day the music died?\n\nWe started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\"\n\nOh, and there we were all in one place\nA generation lost in space\nWith no time left to start again\nSo, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick\nJack Flash sat on a candlestick\n'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend\nOh, and as I watched him on the stage\nMy hands were clenched in fists of rage\nNo angel born in Hell\nCould break that Satan spell\nAnd as the flames climbed high into the night\nTo light the sacrificial rite\nI saw Satan laughing with delight\nThe day the music died\n\nHe was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\"\n\nI met a girl who sang the blues\nAnd I asked her for some happy news\nBut she just smiled and turned away\nI went down to the sacred store\nWhere I'd heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn't play\nAnd in the streets, the children screamed\nThe lovers cried and the poets dreamed\nBut not a word was spoken\nThe church bells all were broken\nAnd the three men I admire most\nThe Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\n\nAnd there I stood alone and afraid\nI dropped to my knees and there I prayed\nAnd I promised Him everything I could give\nIf only He would make the music live\nAnd He promised it would live once more\nBut this time one would equal four\nAnd in five years four had come to mourn\nAnd the music was reborn\n\nAnd they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\"\n\nThey were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\""

    "lyrics": "I got my driver's license last week\nJust like we always talked about\n'Cause you were so excited for me\nTo finally drive up to your house\nBut today, I drove through the suburbs\nCrying 'cause you weren't around\n\nAnd you're probably with that blonde girl\nWho always made me doubt\nShe's so much older than me\nShe's everything I'm insecure about\nYeah, today, I drove through the suburbs\n'Cause how could I ever love someone else?\n\nAnd I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one\nAnd I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone\nGuess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me\n'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street\n\nAnd all my friends are tired\nOf hearing how much I miss you, but\nI kinda feel sorry for them\n'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do\nYeah, today, I drove through the suburbs\nAnd pictured I was driving home to you\n\nAnd I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh\nAnd I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone\nI guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me\n'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street\n\nRed lights, stop signs\nI still see your face in the white cars, front yards\nCan't drive past the places we used to go to\n'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)\nSidewalks we crossed\nI still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing\nOver all the noise\nGod, I'm so blue, know we're through\nBut I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)\n\nI know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one\nAnd I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone\nGuess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me\n'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street\n\nYeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"
